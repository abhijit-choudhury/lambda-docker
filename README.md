# lambda-docker
Create a Lambda Docker based Lambda which is integrated with an API Gateway, and also interacts with a backend API, Mongo DB

Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html

Important : Don't change the references for files, all must be ./pathtofile.js irrespective of being placed in different folder, Docker Copy is not copying the folders

1. Install aws cli v2
2. Create a user with proper rights and add it to aws cli
    aws configure
3. Build docker
    docker build -t lambda-docker .     
4. Test docker build
    docker run -p 9000:8080 lambda-docker
5. Test endpoint 2015-03-31 is api version dont try to change it
    curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{ "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3" }'
6. Create a container repository with the same name lambda-docker in AWS ECR
7. Authenticate the Docker to your Amazon ECR registry, 123456789012 below is your acc id, us-east-1 is the region
    aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 138796788942.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
8. Tag and push docker image to AWS ECR
    docker tag  lambda-docker:latest 138796788942.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lambda-docker:latest
    docker push 138796788942.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lambda-docker:latest
9. Create a lambda function using container, option available on US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Frankfurt), South America (SÃ£o Paulo). 

    Select N. Virginia as we also pushed our docker to the ECR in same region us-east-1
10. Create and attach a new policy below to the role assigned to the lambda, this is needed so that the lambda can be deployed into a VPC with public subnet
else it cannot make call to external api calls to mongodb etc
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
        "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
        "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:AttachNetworkInterface"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

11. Create a VPC with a private and public subnet using wizard, it requires an Elastic IP as prerequisite for NAT

12. Update lambda configuration to add the VPC, Private Subnet and Security Group

13. Create api gateway and attach the lambda and test, follow steps from below link

    Integration Request

        Adding two Mapping Templates application/xml with VTL: 
        {
        "body" : $input.json('$'),
        "headers": {"Content-Type":"$input.params('Content-Type')"}
        }

    Integration Response

        Delete application/json from Mapping Templates
        Enable Content handling Passthrough
        Add text/xml as new Mapping Template with VTL:
        
        $input.path('$.body')

    Method Response

        Remove Response Model Empty for Content-Type application/json for HTTP Status 200
        Add Response Model Empty for Content-Type application/xml
